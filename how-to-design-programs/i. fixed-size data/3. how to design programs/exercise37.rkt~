;; Exercise 37. Design the function string-rest, which produces a string like the given one with the first character removed.
; The function uses the string data type to represent and modify textual information
; String -> String
; The functiont takes a string, and returns a new string with the first character removed from the input string.
; input: "hello world" expected: "ello world"
; input: "A Silent Voice" expected: " Silent Voice"
; (define (string-rest str) (.. str ...)

(define (string-rest str)
  (substring str 1))
  
(string-rest "hello world") ; "ello world"
(string-rest "A Silent Voice") ; " Silent Voice"
